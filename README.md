# PROBots
My old PROBots script **[needs to be updated]**

This script is missing the table called **users** that contains: `idx`, `id`, `user`, `avatar`, `home`, `nick`, `status`, `powers`, `extrapowers`, `lastseen`, `d0`, `d2`, `optout`

Also missing the table called **errors** that contains: `index`, `type`, `botid`, `error`, `time`

And some other tables... called **translations** and **transfer**


I'm releasing it because this is my backup stored in my SSD, I wont remake it, I wont use it and I wont help with it, update if you know.
